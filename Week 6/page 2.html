        <p>Here's some background information
             on me. <br> I'm 23 years old,
            A member of the national guard, and an avid gamer.
        One dream that I have, is to be able to stream for a living.<br> 
    I hope to get a media arts degree to further my knowledge in the 
field and hone my skills. Here's some things I've created this far!</p>
